This little micro:bit demo tests your reactions by seeing how quickly you can press a button before the time runs out!

# Tasks

- It seems to always pick the right button, hunt down the bug and fix it
- Figure out why the square only seems to flash up once, as opposed to 3 times, and fix the issue
- Use the `correct_button_pressed` function to display a game over screen if you run out of time to press the right button
- Keep track of the players score (how many times they've answered correctly)
- Display the players score when the game is over
